    "\n",
    "In this study, we will protect one specified plan against contingencies. Our plan is to maintain the winter sport tourism in this particular region, with the help of artifical snow making. The objective is to avoid a climate change induced socio-economic tipping point.\n",

    " \n",
    "What we also could examine:\n",
    " - A cash injection when the resort is at risk of bankruptcy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generation of scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, 68 time series are available, with daily precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature. These 68 series belong to three different climate scenarios:\n",
    " - 31 realisations for RCP8.5\n",
    " - 25 realisations for RCP4.5\n",

    "### Snow cover model\n",
    "The snow cover model (currently C#), converts the P,T_min,T_max daily time series into a daily time-series with snow cover (snow depth) per time-step. The model accounts for accretion, precipitation, and evaporation.\n",

    "In the most simple form, we do not try to mimic the financial position of the resort over time, but simply use a rule-of-thumb which common among ski operators: the 100-day rule. A good snow day is defined as a day with a snow cover of at least 30 cm. One needs at least 100 days of good snow conditions, on average, to have a profitable resort. A bankruptcy (tipping point) occurs when there is 3 years with less than 100 days of good snow cover in a row.\n"
