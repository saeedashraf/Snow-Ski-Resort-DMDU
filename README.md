This project analyses the impact of climate change on the financial situation and tipping points of Ski resorts.

repo with the code, data, and analysis for the Ski project of University of ZÃ¼rich.
The repository contains the code and partial data for the manuscript:

## Getting Started
To set up a working example, clone the GitHub repository and install all software requirements listed in the requirements.txt. Main tool used is Python. Installing within an Anaconda environment is recommended.

In order to run illustrative examples six downloads are required from:


Once repository is set up locally with all code and correctly placed data, follow below instructions for each step.

## Case Studies:
In total six ski resorts were selected for this study:

1. https://www.sattel-hochstuckli.ch/en  (800m to 1200) - Central Switzerland
2. https://www.atzmaennig.ch/en/winter/  (800-1200) Zurich Region
3. https://www.hoch-ybrig.ch/en/winter/service/brochure/  (900-1900) Central Switzerland

### Topics
`Snow model` `Ablation` `Accumulation`

In this task, a modular grid-based snow model was developed. The current model consists of Ablation, and Accumulation modules, with the possibility of adding new modules in the future. The main

## Outputs:
The results of the snow model (csv format) for the case studies are collected. In these analyses, no elevation bands were considered for Villars-Diablerets and Jakobshorn case studies.

After considering elevation bands (500m) for the case study No.4 (Villars-Diableret) and No.6 ( Jakobshorn), new results were generated.

After considering the uncertainty of climate scenarios by producing 68 new climate scenarios, and running the snow model, the new results were produced
