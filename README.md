This project analyses the impact of climate change on the financial situation and tipping points of Ski resorts.

repo with the code, data, and analysis for the Ski project of University of ZÃ¼rich.
The repository contains the code and partial data for for the manuscript: 

## Getting Started
To set up a working example, clone the github repository and install all software requirements listed in the requirements.txt. Main tool used is Python. Installing within an Anaconda enviroment is recommended.

## Outputs:
The results of the snow model (csv format) for the case studies are collected [here](Outputs_Results). In these analyses, no elevation bands were considered for Villars-Diablerets and Jakobshorn case studies. 

After considering elevation bands (500m) for the case study No.4 (Villars-Diableret) and No.6 ( Jakobshorn), new results were generated.

After considering the uncertainty of climate scenarios by producing 68 new climate scenarios, and runing the snow model, the new results were produced
